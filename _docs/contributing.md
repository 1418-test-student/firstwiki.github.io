title: Contributing to FIRSTwiki
---

FIRSTwiki is an open project that all members of the FIRST community can easily
and quickly contribute to. We believe that by providing open content we can
better serve the FIRST community.

How to contribute
-----------------

FIRSTwiki is not a traditional wiki, instead it's a bunch of
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted files stored
in a git repository that are rendered and served via [github
pages](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) (via
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)). In order for your changes to be published on
the FIRSTwiki site, you must follow the following process:

* Create a github account
* Create a fork of the relevant firstwiki repository
* Make the changes
* Commit them to the repository
* [Create new Pull Request on github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

Once your pull request has been created, a member of the [moderator
team](/docs/moderators) will have to approve the changes. Your changes will be
published as soon as the pull request is merged.

Tips
----
  
* Prefer to use [liquid templates](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) and
  [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to display repetitive
  content, instead of copy/pasting the same stuff across multiple pages
